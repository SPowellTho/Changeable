# Changeable
A Logo Editor

#WHY

As someone who is interested in all types of design, my friends have asked me to make logos for them in the past. However, the problem of color always arises. Most times, they are not sure what color they want the logo to be and it takes a lot of time for me to keep going back to my software make the changes. This program was a way for me too remedy this issue.

#WHAT

What the program does is take a base image and edits both the background and logo until the user is satisfied and saves the editted logo. Included in the Executable folder is "ChangeableLogo.png" a test image made to work with this program. Feel free to use your own images but be aware that this program was made for specific personal projects and as such, requires a specific style. The program works with white images on an empty background. Also, larger images don't exactly fit into the program as intended. With those limitation in mind, it is still quiet easy to use the program. One day, I may choose to recreate this program with the QT framework, but as of now I am done with this project.

#HOW

This program was made using Game Maker Studio because it excels at making programs with an interactable GUI. As implied earlier, I made this program beforing learning the QT framework so Game Maker was the next best choice. This does mean that a copy of Game Maker must be used to open the source code, but the executable should be able to run on Windows PCs without it.
